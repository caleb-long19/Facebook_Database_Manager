# Database Manager Application
This repository is being used in order to store my Database Application for the ISAD157 Coursework. 
The Repository will provide my Visual Studio Folder which contains my code for my Database Application,
it also provides my UML and Normalisation diagrams in a clearer format than what is displayed on my Report.
An exe for the Application is also available to test!

# How To Ue The Application
Once you load the Application you will need to select what table you wish to display in the Data Grid. To do this
select the drop menu in the bottom right corner and select a Table. The Data will automatically be imported and displayed.

To update User Data, select a user in the Facebook Users table, the data will be shown in the Text Boxes on the left,
replace the data that has been inserted in those Text Boxes and select the Update button underneath.

To Delete a User you must select a User in the Data Grid, click the delete button and their information will
be removed from the Database.

To search for a User, you can input their Name or ID in the search box. The search box can be found at the top
left of the application.

# YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE USER ID AS IT'S BEING USED AS A PRIMARY KEY!
